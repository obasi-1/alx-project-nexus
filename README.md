# Project Nexus Documentation

# Overview

This repository documents my major learnings and experiences from the 'ProDev Backend Engineering Program'.  
It serves as a central hub for the concepts, tools, and best practices I explored during the course.


# Key Technologies Covered

Python: Core programming language for backend development.
Django: Web framework for building scalable backend systems.
REST APIs: Design and implementation of API endpoints for communication.
GraphQL: Query language for flexible and efficient data fetching.
Docker: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for automated workflows.


# Important Backend Development Concepts

Database Design: Designing relational schemas, relationships, and ensuring data integrity.
Asynchronous Programming: Leveraging async features for non-blocking I/O operations.
Caching Strategies: Using caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to improve performance and scalability.


# Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. Understanding Asynchronous Programming
    Challenge: Difficulty grasping event loops and async/await.
    Solution: Practiced by building small async projects and debugging with logging.

2. Docker Setup Issues
    Challenge: Managing container networking and volume mounting.
    Solution: Used Docker Compose and official documentation to simplify configuration.

3. CI/CD Pipeline Failures
    Challenge: Pipelines failing due to environment variable misconfigurations.
    Solution: Implemented `.env` management and GitHub Actions secrets for secure handling.


# Best Practices and Personal Takeaways
 Write clean, modular, and testable code.
 Always document APIs (Swagger, GraphQL Playground).
 Use version control effectively (Git branching strategies).
 Securely manage environment variables and sensitive data.
 Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
